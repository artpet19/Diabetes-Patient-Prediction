# Diabetes-Patient-Prediction
Overview
This repository contains a machine learning model (Random Forest) to predict whether a patient has diabetes based on various health metrics. The model is trained on the Diabetes dataset and uses features such as glucose levels, blood pressure, and BMI to make predictions.

Features
Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, feature scaling, and encoding categorical variables.
Model Training: Training various machine learning models and selecting the best one based on performance metrics.
Model Evaluation: Evaluating the model using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Deployment: Deploying the model using Flask for real-time predictions.
